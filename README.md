# Blood Pressure Analysis of Patients

This project analyzes patient blood pressure data collected **before and after** treatment or intervention. The dataset contains information about each patient's:

- Patient number
- Age group
- Gender
- Blood pressure before treatment
- Blood pressure after treatment

### ðŸ“Š Visualizations & Insights

The analysis includes:
- Histogram with KDE to show distribution of blood pressure before and after
- BP changes by gender and age group
- Scatter plots comparing BP before vs after
- Proportion of patients whose blood pressure improved
- Statistical summary of the dataset

This can help identify patterns in how different groups (e.g., males vs females, age groups) respond to treatment.
